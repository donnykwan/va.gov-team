# Beneficiary Travel (BTSSS)
BTSSS is a stand alone web application that allows Veterans to submit and manage claims to be paid back for mileage and other travel expenses to and from approved health care appointments, and to manage associated data.

## About the Product

### Vision
Deliver a seamless and positive experience for any Veteran who needs to submit or manage travel claims, with a focus on automated processing of most claims.

### User Problem Statement
Veterans are not able to easily discover, access, authenticate into and complete travel claims using BTSSS due to a complex user experience that was not built using human centered design principles. 

Staff travel clerks often have to take manual steps to fix, validate and process claims that were entered erroneously or on paper.

## What We're Working On
- 18F is conducting a 10-week Path Analysis,aka, consulting project on VA's BTSSS. We are looking at the BTSSS problem holistically, such as user painpoints, business need, orgainization and culture, processes, GRC (Governanmce, Risk & Compliance), legal mandates and technology.
- Major initiatves include interviews (veterans, business owner & claim clerks), processes and technology reviews.
- After we gather all the relevant data,  we will perform data analysis and write a recommendataion report at the end of the project.
- The recommendations shall aim to make the health travel claim much easier and reduce the claim cycle (from start to money in the bank) significantly.
